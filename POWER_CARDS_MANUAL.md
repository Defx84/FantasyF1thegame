# Fantasy F1 – Power Cards Manual

## How the Power Card System Works

Power cards are available **only in seasons 2026 and later**. They let you boost or change how your driver and team selections score each race weekend.

### Deck (My Deck)

- Each league member builds a **deck** from the full card pool.
- **Driver deck**: exactly **12 slots**. You pick driver cards whose slot costs add up to 12.
- **Team deck**: exactly **10 slots**. You pick team cards whose slot costs add up to 10.
- **Gold team limit**: You may include **at most 1 gold team card** in your team deck.
- You build or change your deck in the league’s **My Deck** tab. The deck is fixed for the season.

### Activation (per race)

- Before each race (on the **Next Race Selections** page), you:
  - Pick your **Main Driver**, **Reserve Driver**, and **Team** as usual.
  - Optionally **activate** one **driver card** and/or one **team card** for that race.
- Activated cards apply only to **that race**. They are **one-use per season**: once you use a card in a race, you cannot use it again in the same season.
- You must **save your driver/team selections first**, then activate cards. Some cards require an extra **target** (another player, a driver, or a team) when you activate them.

### When effects apply

- Card effects are applied when race results are in and points are calculated (automatically or by admin).
- Driver cards generally affect your **driver points** (main and/or reserve, depending on the card).
- Team cards affect your **team points**.
- **Mystery** (driver) and **Mystery** (team) are special: at activation time they turn into a **random** card of that type; that random card’s effect is then applied for the race.
